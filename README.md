# K-means in Java
K-means algorithm implementation in Java for a University project

Dataset (1200 points):
* 150 points inside square [0.9, 1.2] x [0.8, 1.2]
* 150 points inside square [0, 0.5] x [0, 0.5]
* 150 points inside square [0, 0.5] x [1.5, 2]
* 150 points inside square [1.5, 2] x [0, 0.5]
* 150 points inside square [1.5, 2] x [1.5, 2]
* 75 points inside square [0.8, 1.2] x [0, 0.4]
* 75 points inside square [0.8, 1.2] x [1.6, 2]
* 75 points inside square [0.3, 0.7] x [0.8, 1.2]
* 75 points inside square [1.3, 1.7] x [0.8, 1.2]
* 150 points inside square [0, 2] x [0, 2]

Variable M: number of clusters
Printed in the terminal: current iteration, two lists with the center coordinates of the clusters (x and y), error.
